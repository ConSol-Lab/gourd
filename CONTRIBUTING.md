# Contribution guidelines

Please refer to the maintainer documentation.

An artifact is available from the GitLab pipeline `documentation` job, or
[here](https://gourd.chla.cz/manpages/maintainer.pdf)

The document contains all contribution guidelines,
code style and explanations as to the structure of the application.

But if that seems too long to read
a good first step is to run:

```
git config --local core.hooksPath .hooks/
```
